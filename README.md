# Architecture-Mini-Project-Phase-2
The objective of this mini-project is to enhance concepts in computer architecture by designing a game using the C programming language that runs on DE1‐SOC, DE10‐standard, or DE0‐CV and uses a VGA monitor as one of its outputs.

# We can run game without using DE1‐SOC, DE10‐standard, DE0‐CV and VGA monitor using this website:- https://cpulator.01xz.net/

# Select Nios-2 as architecture.
